## Introduction and purpose
This project is developed for Java101 course on <a href="https://patika.dev">patika.dev</a>. Aim of project is to find prime numbers between 1 and 100.

## Brief algorithm
Task is achieved by using 2 nested loops. Divisibility is checked for outer loops indice to inner loops indice. If two indices are divisible, relevant indice (number) is assigned as not prime, else relevant indice assigned as prime.
